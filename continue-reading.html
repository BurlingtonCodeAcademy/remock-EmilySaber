      <h3><br>JERRY GARCIA & BOB WEIR, SAN FRANCISCO 1989</h3>
      <p>Annie laid her head down in the roses. She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair. I don't know,
        maybe it was the roses. All I know, I could not leave her there. I don't know, it must have been the roses. The
        roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair. I don't know, maybe it was the roses. All I know, I could not leave
        her there. Ten years the waves rolled the ships home from the sea. Thinking well how it may blow in all good
        company. If I tell another what your own lips told to me. Let me lay 'neath the roses and my eyes no longer see.
        One pane of glass in the window. No one is complaining, though, come in and shut the door. Faded is the crimson
        from the ribbons that she wore. And it's strange how no one comes round any more....</p>
      <h3><br>YUP, YOU GOT THAT RIGHT!</h3>
      <p>Anyways heres the lyrics to, "Friend of the Devil"... I lit up from Reno. I was trailed by twenty hounds.
        Didn't get to sleep that night Till the morning came around Set out running but I'll take my time A friend of
        the Devil is a friend of mine If I get home before daylight I just might get some sleep tonight I ran into the
        Devil, babe He loaned me twenty bills I spent that night in Utah In a cave up in the hills. I set out running
        but I take my time A friend of the devil is a friend of mine If I get home before daylight I just might get some
        sleep tonight. I ran down to the levee But the Devil caught me there He took my twenty dollar bill And he
        vanished in the air. I set out running but I take my time. A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine. If I get
        home before daylight. I just might get some sleep tonight. Got two reasons why I cry. Away each lonely night.
        The first one's named sweet Anne Marie And she's my heart's delight. Second one is prison, baby. The sheriff's
        on my trail. And if he catches up with me. I'll spend my life in jail. Got a wife in Chino, babe
        And one in Cherokee. First one says she's got my child. But it don't look like me. I set out running but I take
        my time. A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine. If I get home before daylight. I just might get some sleep
        tonight....
