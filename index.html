      <p>Annie laid her head down in the roses. She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair. I don't know,
        maybe it was the roses. All I know, I could not leave her there. I don't know, it must have been the roses. The
        roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair. I don't know, maybe it was the roses. All I know, I could not leave
        her there. Ten years the waves rolled the ships home from the sea. Thinking well how it may blow in all good
        company. If I tell another what your own lips told to me. Let me lay 'neath the roses and my eyes no longer see.
        One pane of glass in the window. No one is complaining, though, come in and shut the door. Faded is the crimson
        from the ribbons that she wore. And it's strange how no one comes round any more..........</p>
