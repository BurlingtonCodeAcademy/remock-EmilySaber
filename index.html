    <h3><br>JERRY GARCIA & BOB WEIR, SAN FRANCISCO 1989</h3>
    <p>Annie laid her head down in the roses. She had ribbons, ribbons, ribbons in her long brown hair. I don't know,
      maybe it was the roses. All I know, I could not leave her there. I don't know, it must have been the roses. The
      roses or the ribbons in her long brown hair. I don't know, maybe it was the roses. All I know, I could not leave
      her there. Ten years the waves rolled the ships home from the sea. Thinking well how it may blow in all good
      company. If I tell another what your own lips told to me. Let me lay 'neath the roses and my eyes no longer see.
      One pane of glass in the window. No one is complaining, though, come in and shut the door. Faded is the crimson
      from the ribbons that she wore. And it's strange how no one comes round any more....</p><br><a

    <h3><br>YUP, YOU GOT THAT RIGHT!</h3>
    <p>Anyways heres the lyrics to, "Friend of the Devil"... I lit up from Reno. I was trailed by twenty hounds.
      Didn't get to sleep that night Till the morning came around Set out running but I'll take my time A friend of
      the Devil is a friend of mine If I get home before daylight I just might get some sleep tonight I ran into the
      Devil, babe He loaned me twenty bills I spent that night in Utah In a cave up in the hills. I set out running
      but I take my time A friend of the devil is a friend of mine If I get home before daylight I just might get some
      sleep tonight. I ran down to the levee But the Devil caught me there He took my twenty dollar bill And he
      vanished in the air. I set out running but I take my time. A friend of the Devil is a friend of mine. If I get
      home before daylight.....
